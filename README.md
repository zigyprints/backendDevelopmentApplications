## **Vibhanshu's Assignment**

**Technologies Used:**
1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB
4. Postman

**My Approach**

My apporached the task first setting up a basic framework for the application trying to figure out what basic blocks do we need for the application.
So I first setup all the basic files and packages we need without implmenting any functional as for now,

After I was sure that my framework for the application is ready, I starting making connections and connecting different parts together.

After everything was connected and I was getting a basic console log by making requests on postman, I started implementing the CRUD functionality and added functionality to all the controllers.

After that I added error handling and connected it with the application.

After that I use Mockaroo to add alot of data into the database. I added all the data by using populate.js script.

Once the application was complete I deployed it on Render.

**Challeneges Faced**

Only trouble I faced was with connecting different error handling together and handling all the errors but eventually I was able to handle all the basic errors.

**Feature and Improvements**

1. We could have added a login and authorization system in the app. Where all login user will have their separate tasks.
2. We could have added more error specific error handling rather than just general error handling.
3. We could have added a feature to track time of the task or put a time constraint on the task if user wanted.
4. We could have added notification system which will remind user of any pending task.
