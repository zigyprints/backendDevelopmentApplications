# Simple Backend API Development with TypeScript

Welcome to my submission for the Simple Backend API Development assignment! In this project, I have built a basic RESTful API backend using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB for a "To-Do List" application.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- MongoDB

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/backendDevelopmentApplications.git

2. Change the directory to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd backendDevelopmentApplications

3. Install the dependencies and build the project:
   ```sh
   npm install && npm run build

4. Run the server:
   ```sh
   npm start

## Error Handling

Proper error handling is implemented for various scenarios, ensuring a robust backend with strict typing. Detailed error messages are provided in the responses.

## Postman Documentation

Detailed documentation for the API endpoints can be found in the [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24017362/2s9Y5YRhRz), which provides information about the requests, responses, and usage of the API.

## Deployment

The backend has been deployed on Render. You can access it using the following link: [Render Deployment](https://todolist-1mvk.onrender.com).
