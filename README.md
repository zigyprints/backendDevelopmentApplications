This is a todo_list assignment written in typescript. The main challenge I faced during building this project was dealing with types. I learned a bit of typescript and realised how efficient it is for removing type errors. Especially when it comes to data validation from a front end. Typescript can do the validation easily. 

Main challenge I faced was with user creation. Though it wasn't part of the assignment I thought it only makes sense to create a user authorization and authentication. I learned about JWT Tokens which can be used to handle sessions efficiently and increase more security overall. My plan was to have authentication middlewares for the todo operations such that if user isn't logged on they cannot perform todo operations etc.

More features can be added to this assignment, like we can add priority of a given task(using the power of typescript we can use literals for allowing only specific allows to be types like priority : "high" | "low" | "medium").
