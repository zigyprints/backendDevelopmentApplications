# Simple Backend API Development with TypeScript

## Introduction
Backend for a Todo list application built using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB as the database. It offers a RESTful API with endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks. MongoDB is used to store task data, and the code includes error handling and follows best practices in API design.

## Approach
1.Project Structure: Organize the project with a clear directory structure for controllers, models, routes, and main application files.

2.TypeScript: Use TypeScript for strict typing and enhanced code quality.

3.Express.js: Build the API using Express.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.

4.Database: Depending on the choice of database (MongoDB or SQLite), create a schema/model for tasks and handle database interactions.

5.API Endpoints: Implement RESTful API endpoints for task creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

6.Error Handling: Handle errors gracefully with appropriate status codes and error responses.

7.API Documentation: Optionally, create API documentation using Postman or other tools to help users understand and use your API.

## Challenges
1.Deployment: Deploying the backend to a production environment and configuring server settings, security, and monitoring.
- Solution:Follow Railway's documentation and guidelines for deploying Node.js applications.
